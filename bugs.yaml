      problem:

    details:
      issue: "Cards still washed out in light theme despite opacity fixes"
      impact: "MEDIUM - Light theme cards blend into background"
      
      problem:
        - "Light theme uses rgba() hardcoded values instead of color-mix()"
        - "Decision cards: rgba(98, 216, 78, 0.85) - too bold/inconsistent"
        - "Background gradient too vibrant (lime green)"
        - "CSS cascade issues: .light-theme overrides flatten card gradients"
      
      rootCause: "Theme architecture inconsistency (see BUG-004)"
      
      attemptedFixes:
        - fix: "Increased card opacity to 0.98"
          result: "Partial improvement, still washed out"
        - fix: "Added card-specific light theme gradients"
          result: "Better but inconsistent with dark theme"
        - fix: "Increased decision card green to 0.85 opacity"

      issue: "Dark and light themes use completely different CSS patterns"
      impact: "LOW (functional) / HIGH (maintainability, AI-friendliness)"
      
      problem:
        darkTheme:
          pattern: "Uses color-mix() with CSS variables"
          example: "color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent-primary), transparent 85%)"
          benefits: "Consistent, variable-driven, AI-friendly"
        
        lightTheme:
          pattern: "Uses hardcoded rgba() values"
          example: "rgba(98, 216, 78, 0.85)"
          issues: "Brittle, inconsistent, AI-unfriendly"
        
        consequences:
          - "Two different systems to maintain"
          - "AI confusion when modifying themes"
          - "Governance failure (violates AI-first principles)"
          - "Difficult to ensure visual consistency"
      
      proposedSolution:
        approach: "Unify both themes to use color-mix() pattern"
        implementation:
          - "Light theme overrides CSS variables only"
          - "Both themes use same gradient structure"
          - "Single source of truth for card styling"
