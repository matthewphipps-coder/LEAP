outcomes:
  bold_outcome: "NEXUS becomes an AI-native workbench where conversation drives action and a dynamic visual canvas provides ambient context — replacing the traditional form paradigm with human-AI collaboration surfaces"

  success_criteria:
    - "User can complete record update entirely via conversation (text or voice)"
    - "Voice input (STT) is successfully captured and processed as intent"

    - "UI explicitly transforms into 'Decision Mode' for pre-commit approval"
    - "User can access a 'Data Backdoor' to view raw record state"
    - "Design successfully renders multiple TASK extensions (Incident, Case) with same component code"
    - "Final commit happens via AI with human confirmation (Gatekeeping)"
