objective: Lock requirements and prepare final specifications for build

description: |
  Stage T-1 (Spec) locks the functional requirements from T-2 Design and prepares
  the final specification documents for the Factory AI build process.

inputs_from_t2_design:
  - SPEC-004-card-canvas.yaml (comprehensive functional spec)
  - VISUAL-GUIDE.md (GoldSource integration patterns)
  - SPEC-004-prototype.html (visual reference)
  - 5 screenshots (visual targets)

outputs:
  final_spec:
    file: ../T-2_Design/SPEC-004-card-canvas.yaml
    status: locked
    description: >
      Requirements are locked. YAML spec contains all functional requirements.
      Visual Guide provides HOW to build it with GoldSource patterns.
  
  build_ready:
    - Functional specification (WHAT)
    - Implementation guide (HOW)
    - Visual references (screenshots)
    - Prototype for validation

acceptance_criteria:
  - All T-2 Design artifacts reviewed and approved
  - No requirement changes from this point forward
  - Specification is clear and unambiguous for Factory AI
  - Visual targets accurately represent desired UI
  - GoldSource integration patterns documented

notes: |
  T-2 Design phase produced comprehensive documentation:
  - 20KB YAML specification
  - Complete Visual Guide with code patterns
  - Working prototype with fresh screenshots
  
  No further design work needed. Requirements are locked for build.

next_stage: T-0_Lock (prepare for Factory AI build)
