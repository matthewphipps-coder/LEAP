  summary: |
    Evaluated existing MCP server implementations for ServiceNow.
    Cloned two repos for analysis. Identified architectural patterns.

  mcpServers:
    - repo: "michaelbuckner/servicenow-mcp"
      location: "1_LEAP/3_R&D_GoldSource/MCP_Research/servicenow-mcp"
      pythonVersion: "3.8+"
      features:
        incidentCRUD: true
        naturalLanguage: true
        changeManagement: false
        serviceCatalog: false
        knowledgeBase: "basic"
        sseMode: false
        toolPackaging: false
      notes: "Simpler, has natural language search"

    - repo: "echelon-ai-labs/servicenow-mcp"
      location: "1_LEAP/3_R&D_GoldSource/MCP_Research/servicenow-mcp-echelon"
      pythonVersion: "3.11+"
      features:
        incidentCRUD: true
        naturalLanguage: false
        changeManagement: true
        serviceCatalog: true
        knowledgeBase: true
        sseMode: true
        toolPackaging: true
      notes: "More comprehensive, role-based tool packages"

  keyInsights:
    - insight: "MCP servers run locally"
      detail: "Python process on developer machine, not cloud hosted"
    
    - insight: "Adapter pattern is common"
      detail: "MCP server already acts as adapter between AI and SoR"
    
    - insight: "SSE enables real-time push"
      detail: "echelon version supports Server-Sent Events for streaming"

  recommendation: |
    Use echelon-ai-labs version as reference for ServiceNow adapter.
    More feature-complete and has SSE support for push scenarios.
