  key_decisions:
    - "'My Work' page is IMMUTABLE/LOCKED core functionality."
    - "Sidebar & Canvas patterns must be reusable for new Factory pages."
    - "Header Badges must support Amber/Red states (Global Shell update)."
  carry_forward:
    - "Spec must distinguish between 'Core Page Logic' (Locked) and 'Reusable Component Logic' (Extensible)."
    - "Header requires 'Badge Color' prop support."
