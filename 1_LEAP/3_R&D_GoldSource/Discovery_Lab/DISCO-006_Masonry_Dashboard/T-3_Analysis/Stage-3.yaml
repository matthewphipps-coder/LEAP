  - "Identify risks, performance impacts, and security concerns"

outputs:
  - "Risk assessment notes in DISCOVERY_LOG.md"

outcomes:
  risks:
    - "Coupling: Sidebar needs to know about Card Drops. Risk of circular dependency."
    - "Layout: Masonry 'column-count' causes DOM order mismatch (Top-Down vs Logical Left-Right)."
  mitigations:
    - "Coupling: Use Custom Events ('sidebar-action') or State Store (Source of Truth) to decouple."
    - "Layout: Accept DOM order mismatch for Phase 1 (Visual fidelity first)."
  technical_decisions:
    - "Architecture: Use `Standard Event Bus` for Drag & Drop (Native API)."
    - "CSS: Use `column-count` (CSS Columns) for Masonry, not JS Grid (Performance)."
    - "Data: Card Schema must include `priority`, `updates` (int), `size` (small/med/large)."
  dependencies:
    - "Lucide Icons (Existing)"
    - "State Management (Existing Phase 36)"
