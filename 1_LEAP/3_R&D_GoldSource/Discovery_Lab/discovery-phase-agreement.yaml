# Discovery Phase Agreement: Spec Protocol

agreement_id: DISCO-2026-001
topic: Stage -5 (Ideation) Lock-in
date: 2026-01-22
status: PARTIAL_LOCK (Stage -5 only)

## 🔒 Locked Decisions

### 1. Stage -6: The DreamBig Idea!
- The starting point of every discovery.
- **Requirement**: The user provides a few sentences of their "Big Idea" vs technical requirements.

### 2. Stage -5: Divergent Research & Ideation
- This is a **Divergent** step focused on expansion rather than narrowing.
- **Goal**: AI-driven web research and brainstorming to expand the problem space.

### 3. Stage -4: Convergence & Scoping
- This is a **Convergent** step.
- **Goal**: Condense the Stage -5 output into a "Bold but Manageable" scope.
- **Governance Patch (Anti-Fatigue)**: A forced breakpoint is recommended here to reset context window and combat human fatigue.

### 4. Stage -3: Analysis & Risk
- **Goal**: Thoroughly research bold ideas from every aspect (Technical, Risk, Feasibility).

### 5. Stage -2: Define & Document
- **Goal**: Utilize various methodologies (User Stories, Design Thinking, Diagrams) to formalize the research findings into a documented design.

### 6. Stage -1: Functional Spec & Supporting Artifacts
- **Goal**: Create the definitive `SPEC-XXX.yaml` and any prototypes or diagrams.
- **Principle**: Provide exactly what the GoldSource build methodology needs—neither too vague nor too verbose.

### 7. Stage 0: Validate
- **Goal**: Perform a final sanity check before passing to the build phase.
- **Governance Patch (Drift Management)**: MUST include an audit of current GoldSource files to ensure no "spec-drift" has occurred during the discovery period.
- **Verification**:
  - **No Assumptions**: Confirm we haven't assumed functionality exists in GoldSource that doesn't.
  - **Safety**: Ensure proposed changes won't obviously break existing GoldSource patterns.
  - **Readiness**: Confirm the spec is the "right thing" for the build phase.

### 7. Persistent Logging
- Every session MUST maintain a `DISCOVERY_LOG.md` in the `Discovery_Lab`.
- This file serves as the AI's external context memory to prevent data loss.
