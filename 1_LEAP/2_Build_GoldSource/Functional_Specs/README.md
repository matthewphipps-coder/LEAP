# Sprint Functional Specs

> Detailed specifications for scaffold enhancements, one spec = one phase scope.

## Purpose

Pre-define functional areas in detail before starting implementation phases. Each spec:
- Links to a backlog item (LEAP-XXX)
- Scopes work for exactly one phase
- Provides clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Documents technical approach upfront

## Usage

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.yaml` to `SPEC-XXX-[short-name].yaml`
2. Add corresponding backlog item in `tracking/backlog.yaml`
3. Get spec approved before starting phase
4. Reference spec during phase execution

## Naming Convention

```
SPEC-001-state-extension.yaml
SPEC-002-modal-system.yaml
SPEC-003-card-patterns.yaml
```

## Status Flow

```
draft → approved → implemented → (superseded if replaced)
```
