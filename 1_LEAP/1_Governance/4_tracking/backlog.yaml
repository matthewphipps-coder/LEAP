        AI agents are violating GoldSource Increment workflow protocols in ways that
        undermine the governance model. This is a systemic issue requiring documentation
        fixes, structural changes, and validation mechanisms.

      rationale: |
        GoldSource Increment methodology depends on explicit stage gates and user approvals.
        Current documentation is comprehensive but distributed across 5+ files, creating
        cognitive overload. AI agents are not malicious - they're confused by complexity.
        
        The governance model is sound; the presentation needs optimization for AI consumption.
        Think of this as "API documentation" - make the contract unmissable.

      implementationNotes: |
        Recommend implementing in this order:
        1. Quick wins: Add negative guidance to bump-protocol.yaml and ai-onboard.yaml
        2. Core fix: Add STOP markers to goldsource-increment.yaml stages
        3. Add Common Mistakes section
        4. Update stage templates
        5. Validation: Test with Phase 32

        Refactor GoldSource to comply with the existing 'Unidirectional Data Flow' 
        contract in ARCHITECTURE.yaml.
        1. Remove imperative updates (e.g., `updateSidebarForPage`).
        2. Implement Observer Pattern: Sidebar/Header must subscribe to `state.js`.
        3. Move `currentPage` and `user` data into `state.js`.
      rationale: |
        Solves Point 2 (Architecture Ignored) and Point 3 (Race/Load Errors).
        The "Initialization Hang" was caused by `page-router` trying to update 
        the Sidebar before it existed. Subscription decouples this timing.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "No usage of setTimeout in initApp()"

        Require explicit extraction of "Magic Values" (tokens) and "Complex Logic" 
        (layout algorithms, DnD rules) from the prototype *before* build starts.
      rationale: |
        Solves Point 1 (R&D Guidance Failure).
        The Build AI treated prototypes as visual suggestions, ignoring technical intent.
        This forces the AI to read the code, not just the pixels.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "newspec.md includes Stage -0.5"
        - "deconstruction_audit_template.md created"

        1. Define `--header-height`, `--sidebar-width` in `variables.css`.
        2. Update components to use these variables for positioning (`top`, `left`).
      rationale: |
        Fixes the physical overlap bugs (Scaffold Blindness).
        Components currently "guess" their position, causing them to render behind 
        the fixed Header/Sidebar.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "variables.css contains shell dimensions"

      description: |
        Update `bump-protocol.yaml` and `goldsource-increment.yaml` with a 
        mandatory "Salvage Scan". Before deleting a failed phase, the AI must 
        scan for valid artifacts (like Phase 31's masonry prototype) and 
        move them to a `_Salvage/` directory or `snippets/` folder.
      rationale: |
        Solves Point 4 (Documentation Rollback Plan).
        We lost superior code in Phase 31 because "Delete" meant "Destroy".
        Failed phases often contain successful components.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "bump-protocol.yaml includes Salvage Scan step"
        - "AI checks 4_Phases/* before claiming 'no previous work exists'"

        Hardcode artifact paths in `task.md` templates to force usage of `4_Phases/`.
        Update `coding-standards.yaml` to explicitly forbid writing phase artifacts 
        to the project root or `1_LEAP/`.
      rationale: |
        Solves Point 5 (Folder Discipline).
        AI agents default to the root directory when context is weak. 
        Explicit paths in the checklist effectively "jail" the agent to the correct folder.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "task.md template uses absolute or relative-to-root specific paths"
        - "No new artifacts appear in project root during Phase 34"

        Create a simple "Linting Script" for Stage 6 (Validation).
        Script should grep for banned patterns (e.g., `updateSidebarForPage` export, 
        `setTimeout` usage) and required patterns (e.g., `MODULE_CONTRACT`).
      rationale: |
        Solves Point 6 (False Compliance).
        Replaces "I promise I checked" with "The script says PASS".
        Removes the "Box Ticking" bias.
      acceptanceCriteria:

        Update `Stage-8` checklist to require appending new lessons.
        Update `Stage-1` checklist to require Reading this file.
      rationale: |
        Solves Point 7 (Systemic Amnesia).
        Ensures that knowledge (like "Masonry works better than Grid") persists 
        even if the Phase folder is deleted.

        incorrect setState() pattern that doesn't exist.
      rationale: |
        v2.2.0-cmdb-explorer Factory AI attempted wrong API pattern:
          setState('feature', 'setFieldName', value)  // WRONG - doesn't exist
        Correct pattern:
          const stateAPI = registerStateSlice('feature', {...}, {...});
          stateAPI.setFieldName(value);  // Correct
        Factory self-corrected during Stage 6, but pattern should be clearer.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "ARCHITECTURE.yaml includes registerStateSlice code example"
        - "Example shows correct API object destructuring pattern"
        - "Next Factory run uses correct pattern without self-correction"

        Include when to use <dialog> vs custom popover, accessibility considerations,

      rationale: |
        v2.2.0-cmdb-explorer used <dialog> for CI detail popup successfully.
        Pattern works well but is not documented in design system, leading to
        potential inconsistency in future Factory runs.

        This is a conversational AI interface for record editing with:
        - 50/50 split layout (Chat | Dynamic Fields)
        - Bloom-from-click open/close animations
        - window.NEXUS JavaScript API for directive integration

      rationale: |
        DISCO-001 discovery complete. Spec locked. Ready for GoldSource implementation.

        An AI-designed and built visual rendering engine for NEXUS.
        The right pane of the workbench becomes a dynamic canvas where
        AI generates conversation-related visuals on demand.
      vision: |
        AI can build:
        - 8-second videos quickly
        - Images in seconds  
        - Structured HTML in seconds
        - Interactive diagrams
        - Animations
        - Maps, charts, timelines
        
        What if we build a whole new rendering engine designed from
        first principles for AI to provide conversation-related visuals?
        
        The AI chooses what to show based on the conversation context:
        - Fields pane (traditional form)
        - Map (geographic context)
        - Diagram (relationships)
        - Timeline (history)
        - Custom visualization
        - Animation explaining a concept
