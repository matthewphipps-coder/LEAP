        AI agents are violating GoldSource Increment workflow protocols in ways that
        undermine the governance model. This is a systemic issue requiring documentation
        fixes, structural changes, and validation mechanisms.

        GoldSource Increment methodology depends on explicit stage gates and user approvals.
        Current documentation is comprehensive but distributed across 5+ files, creating
        cognitive overload. AI agents are not malicious - they're confused by complexity.
        
        The governance model is sound; the presentation needs optimization for AI consumption.
        Think of this as "API documentation" - make the contract unmissable.

        Recommend implementing in this order:
        1. Quick wins: Add negative guidance to bump-protocol.yaml and ai-onboard.yaml
        2. Core fix: Add STOP markers to goldsource-increment.yaml stages
        3. Add Common Mistakes section
        4. Update stage templates
        5. Validation: Test with Phase 32

      description: |
        Update factory governance to explicitly require that new features be implemented
        in their own `features/{feature-name}` folder, rather than overloading existing
        components (e.g., adding CMDB logic to `canvas-ui.js`).
      rationale: |
        Factory v2.2.1 implemented CMDB Explorer inside the existing Card/Canvas component,
        breaking the "Change Approval" pattern of separation. This degrades modularity.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "FACTORY_README.yaml explicitly forbids implementing new domains in existing feature folders"
        - "Architectural standards updated to enforce 1-to-1 mapping of Domain to Feature Folder"

      description: |
        Ask Matt. This was factory error where it created two goldsources. Add explicit sync step to factory workflow. task.md instructs to 'Start server 
        in demo output' but all code edits happen in 'Factory Workspace'. There is no 
        instruction to sync between them. Most 'caching' issues were actually 'stale code' 
        issues caused by updating Factory while serving un-synced content from Demo Output.
      rationale: |
        Factory AI edits code in the Factory workspace but serves from Demo Output folder.
        Without explicit sync instructions, changes are never propagated, causing confusion
        and false debugging cycles chasing "cache" issues that are actually stale code.
      acceptanceCriteria:
        - "task.md template includes explicit sync step (rsync/cp) before starting server"
        - "Sync step placed between 'code edit' and 'verify fix' phases"
        - "Factory AI cannot claim 'fix complete' without syncing to Demo Output"

        An AI-designed and built visual rendering engine for NEXUS.
        The right pane of the workbench becomes a dynamic canvas where
        AI generates conversation-related visuals on demand.
      vision: |
        AI can build:
        - 8-second videos quickly
        - Images in seconds  
        - Structured HTML in seconds
        - Interactive diagrams
        - Animations
        - Maps, charts, timelines
        
        What if we build a whole new rendering engine designed from
        first principles for AI to provide conversation-related visuals?
        
        The AI chooses what to show based on the conversation context:
        - Fields pane (traditional form)
        - Map (geographic context)
        - Diagram (relationships)
        - Timeline (history)
        - Custom visualization
        - Animation explaining a concept
