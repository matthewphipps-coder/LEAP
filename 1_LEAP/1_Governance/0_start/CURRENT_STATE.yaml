      Stage 1 Discovery:
      - Confirmed specOnly workflow (no prototype needed)
      - Identified affected files: base.css, variables.css
      - Scope: 5 CSS utility classes + documentation
      
      Stage 2 Research:
      - Reading base.css (.glass exists, no state patterns)
      - Reading variables.css (dark/light theme tokens)
      - design-system.yaml needs creation
