  summary: "Build the first working prototype of DemoFactory"

    - "LEAP = Governance layer (builds and validates the factory)"

  # CRITICAL - AI Execution Model
  aiExecution:
    core: "Are stages 1-8 executed by AI Agents?"
    implications:
      - "If yes, how do we scope each phase so AI doesn't get confused?"
      - "How do stage artifacts serve as 'handoff contracts' between AI executions?"
      - "Does LEAP validate each stage gate, or just final output?"
      - "What's the AI context window strategy (fresh context per stage vs. accumulated)?"
