# =============================================================================
# LESSONS LEARNED
# =============================================================================

lessonsLearned:
  - lesson: "'Already done' verification is valuable"
    application: "Always check claims from prior phases before implementing"
    example: "Found 2 of 10 items were already complete, saved effort"
  
  - lesson: "Batching related documentation changes is efficient"
    application: "Group changes by target file in Design stage"
    example: "stage-4-design.yaml got 2 items in one edit"
  
  - lesson: "YAML syntax validation catches issues early"
    application: "Run python3 yaml.safe_load() on all modified YAML files"
    example: "All 5 files passed - clean implementation"

# =============================================================================
# HANDOFF TO NEXT PHASE
# =============================================================================

handoff:
  nextPhase: "Phase 22 (TBD)"
  context: |
    Phase 21 completed all planned documentation enhancements.
    Remaining backlog: 9 proposed items across various categories.
    
    Recommended next action: Run Factory v2.0.3 to validate Phase 21 changes.
    This will test whether Factory AI correctly uses the new template sections.
  
  remainingBacklog:
    proposed:
      - "GOV-007 - Add Security Governance Layer"
    note: "GOV-008, GOV-011, LEAP-024, LEAP-025, ARCH-002, USER-003, LEAP-013, LEAP-018 superseded/completed post-Phase 21"
