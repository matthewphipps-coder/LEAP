# SCOPE DECISIONS (User confirmed)
# =============================================================================

scopeDecisions:

  question1:
    topic: "Should GOV-003 also update session-start.yaml?"
    decision: "NO - Start with delivery completionCriteria only"
    rationale: "The drift we caught was end-of-phase, not mid-session"
    revisit: "If drift happens again, add session-start verification"
  
  question2:
    topic: "Should GOV-006 also appear in new-agent.yaml?"
    decision: "NO - Add to constitution only"
    rationale: "Trust agents read constitution. Avoid maintenance burden of duplication"
