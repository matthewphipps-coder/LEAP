# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# =============================================================================

problemStatement:
  summary: "GoldSource governance docs are outdated after Phases 22 and 23"
  context: |
    Phases 22 (DesignSystemEnhancement) and 23 (ExtensibleAppShell) added significant 
    new patterns to the GoldSource scaffold. However, the governance documentation 
    that Factory AI reads was not updated, creating a gap between what exists in code 
    and what's documented.
  
  impact: |
    Factory AI reads GoldSource/meta/* for guidance. Without updated docs:
    - Factory won't know about plasma background, brand color system, animation utilities
    - Factory won't understand PAGE_TABS/PAGE_SIDEBAR_ACTIONS patterns
    - Factory will be confused by floating pill sidebar (docs describe push/pull)
    - Settings dialog and multi-page system are undocumented
