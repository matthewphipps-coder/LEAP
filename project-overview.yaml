project:
  name: "LEAP"
  fullName: "Universal Agentic Workflow Assistant"
  tagline: "The first AI Agent-First, Multimodal, Universal Workflow Assistant"
  motto: "Zen + Awesome. No Rows. No Buttons. Pure Flow."
  version: "v6.8.0-partnership"
  status: "Active Development (Phase 20)"
  owner: "Matthew Phipps (Executive Authority)"

vision:
  summary: "LEAP is a dual-purpose platform: shows the future of ServiceNow in an AI-agent world AND proves AI can build enterprise demos faster than traditional methods"
  tagline: "It's 2026. Reinvent now."
  reference: "See VISION.yaml for complete vision statement"
  
  coreMessage: "LEAP is both the message (AI-first future) AND the medium (AI-built demo)"
  
  keyDifferentiators:
    - "AI agents as first-class citizens (not chatbots)"
    - "Natural language + cards (not forms and lists)"
    - "Built entirely by AI (proof of concept)"
    - "Adapts to any customer scenario (flexible)"

philosophy:
  
  corePhilosophy: "LEAP is not a task manager. It is a Universal Agentic Workflow Interface"
  
  aiCockpit: "The goal isn't just to see the work; it's to do the work without leaving the flow. The Detail View is not a form; it's an Active Studio where the AI has already prepped the data, drafted the email, or analyzed the risk. You don't just check a box—you Authorize Execution."
