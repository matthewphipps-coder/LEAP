  description: "Implement standardized Card System and Canvas Layout (LEAP-061)"
  source: "LEAP-061 (Backlog), SPEC-004 (Discovery Lab)"
  gap: |
    Current GoldSource lacks a standardized card component and dynamic canvas layout.
    SPEC-004 defines a rigorous card system with priority states, sizing, and AI-driven sorting.

scaffoldReview:
  impactedAreas:
    - "src/ui/components/" (New components: nexus-card, nexus-canvas, nexus-nav)
    - "src/ui/styles/" (New variables for card sizes, priority colors)
    - "src/core/" (Potentially state management for cards)
  existingCapabilities:
    - "Design system tokens (glassmorphism) exist"
    - "App Shell exists to host the canvas"
    - "Base utility classes exist"
