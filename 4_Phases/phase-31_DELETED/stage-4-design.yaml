design:
  prototype:
    file: "1_LEAP/2_Build_GoldSource/Functional_Specs/SPEC-004-prototype.html"
    status: "Created"
    keyFeatures:
      - "Drag-and-drop to sidebar horizons"
      - "Dynamic card sizing (Large/Medium/Compact)"
      - "Priority-based badge colors (Urgent/Warning/Neutral)"
      - "AI Re-sort simulation"
  
  decisions:
    componentArchitecture:
      - "nexus-canvas will own the Sidebar logic (Horizon filters)"
      - "nexus-card will be purely presentational data-driven component"
      - "State management will handle 'cards' array and 'horizon' filters"
    
    integrationStrategies:
      - "Sidebar: Injected into main layout or handled via 'canvas-ui.js' equivalent"
      - "Since 'My Work' is a page, the 'Sidebar' for Horizons fits best as a floating pill specific to that page context, as shown in prototype."

nextStep: "Stage 5: Implementation (Scaffold Modification)"
