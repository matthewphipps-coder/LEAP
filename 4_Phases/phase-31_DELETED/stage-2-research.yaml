      - "GoldSource v2.0 scaffold active"
      - "Page routing via #page-{id} sections in index.html"
      - "Existing 'Dashboard' page displays 'data-cards' component"
    
    impacts:
      - "Renaming 'Dashboard' to 'My Work' in core/constants.js"
      - "Replacing 'data-cards' component with 'nexus-canvas'"
      - "Injecting 'nexus-sidebar' into the My Work page (or main sidebar integration)"
      - "New CSS variables for card sizes and priorities"

      - "scaffold/ui/components/nexus-card/nexus-card-ui.js"
      - "scaffold/ui/components/nexus-canvas/nexus-canvas.css"
      - "scaffold/ui/components/nexus-canvas/nexus-canvas-ui.js"
    
    deprecate:
      - "scaffold/ui/components/data-cards/" (Superseded)
      - "scaffold/ui/components/canvas/canvas-ui.js" (Legacy no-op, replace or reuse)

  integrationPoints:
    - "Router: Ensure 'My Work' page ID matches 'dashboard' or update router logic"
    - "State: Need new state slice for 'cards' in state.js (or registered dynamically)"
    - "Styles: Extend design system tokens in variables.css or new css"
