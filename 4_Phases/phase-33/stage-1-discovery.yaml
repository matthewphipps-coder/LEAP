    current_state: "GoldSource build (Phase 32) uses CSS Grid. Prototype input uses CSS Columns (Masonry). DISCO-004 Visual Guide contains contradictory instructions."
    desired_state: "Specifications (v2) accurately reflect the Prototype's Masonry behavior and Plasma/Animation richness."
    gap: "Discrepancy between Inputs and Desired Outcome requires reverse-engineering."
