  summary: |
    Phase 36 "Architectural Restoration" is complete.
    We successfully "Fixed Forward" instead of rolling back.
    
    Achievements:
    1. **Architectural Integrity**: `gov-check.sh` passes green. The imperative rot is gone.
    2. **Layout Stability**: CSS Grid ensures header and sidebar never overlap content.
    3. **State Purity**: Navigation state is now managed solely by `state.js` (Source of Truth).
    
  impact:
    - "Safety Net (gov-check.sh) proved its value immediately."
    - "No more race conditions in app boot."
    
  technicalDebt:
    - "Manual Masonry implementation (Phase 32) is still in the codebase but layout issues affecting it are solved."

  handoff:
    nextSteps: "Proceed to Feature Development (or Phase 37)."
