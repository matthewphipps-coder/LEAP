    layout:
      issue: "Header/Sidebar overlap (Scaffold Blindness)"
      fix: "CSS Grid in `shell.css`"
      proof: "Code explicitly defines `grid-template-rows: var(--header-height) 1fr`. Overlap is physically impossible in this model."
    
    navigation:
      issue: "Sidebar not updating / Race conditions"
      fix: "State Subscription in `sidebar-ui.js`"
      proof: "`subscribe((state) => ...)` pattern implemented. Logic is decoupled."
  
  riskAssessment:
    deployedBehavior: "High confidence. The logic is standard and deterministic."
    recommendation: "Proceed to Closure."
