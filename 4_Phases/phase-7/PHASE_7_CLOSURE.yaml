  name: "Governance Framework Redesign"
  status: "awaiting-signoff"
  date: "2026-01-19"

summary:
  goal: "Redesign governance from monolithic docs into indexed smaller files easier for AI to follow"
  outcome: "SUCCESS"

accomplished:
  - "Created INDEX.yaml as entry point (21 lines)"
  - "Created 3 focused checklists: session-start, before-file-op, before-phase"
  - "Deleted redundant files: PROCEED_PROTOCOL, pulse.md, regression-protocol"
  - "Updated AI_ONBOARDING.yaml to reference INDEX.yaml first"
  - "Reorganized project into logical directories"

lessonsLearned:
  - "AI violates governance even when documented - smaller files may help"
  - "Checklists (action-oriented) may be more effective than explanations"
  - "'Yes' is NOT 'Proceed' - enforced this session multiple times"
  - "8 lifecycle stages work without separate task.md"
