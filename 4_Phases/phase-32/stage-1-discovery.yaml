  gap_analysis:
    current_state: "GoldSource has a basic app shell but lacks the core Card & Canvas UI."
    desired_state: "GoldSource implements DISCO-004 specifications (Card components, Canvas layout modes, Header updates, Navigation integration)."
    gap: "Missing critical UI components and logic defined in SPEC-004."

  inputs:
    spec: "1_LEAP/3_R&D_GoldSource/Discovery_Lab/DISCO-004_Card_And_Canvas_UI/T-0_Lock/SPEC-004-card-canvas.yaml"

    integration_points:
      - "src/ui/components/header-ui.js" (Header toggles)
      - "src/ui/components/sidebar-ui.js" (Navigation badges)
      - "src/core/constants.js" (Page registration)
      - "src/ui/styles/design-system.css" (New tokens)

  workflow_determination:
    selected: "full"
    reason: "Major UI feature with completed spec AND validated prototype. Complexity warrants full lifecycle."

  success_criteria:
    - "GoldSource matches SPEC-004-prototype.html behavior exactly."
    - "New components (Nexus Card, Canvas, Tombstone) implemented."
    - "Design system extended with new tokens."
    - "No regression in existing App Shell features."

next_steps:
  - "Start Stage 2 (Research) in NEW CONVERSATION."
  - "Update CURRENT_STATE.yaml (in Stage 2)."
