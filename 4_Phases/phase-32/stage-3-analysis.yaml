rrmd_plus_assessment:
  breaking_changes:
    - description: "Renaming 'Dashboard' page ID to 'my-work' in constants.js."
      impact: "Low. page-router.js dynamically loads the first tab as default. No hardcoded dependency found except a fallback safety net."
      migration: "Update PAGE_SIDEBAR_ACTIONS key to match new ID."
  
  demo_compatibility:
    impact: "None. No demos exist yet that depend on the dashboard ID."
    future_proofing: "New 'My Work' page is immutable system page. Demos will add their own pages."
  
  rollback_strategy:
    method: "Standard GoldSource backup (Stage 5)."
    recovery: "Restore 2_GoldSource folder from backup if core navigation breaks."

implementation_approach:
  selected_workflow: "Direct"
  reason: "Prototype (SPEC-004-prototype.html) was fully validated in Phase 31. No need to rebuild another prototype. We can proceed directly to implementing the files."
  
  component_architecture:
    card:
      location: "src/ui/components/card/nexus-card-ui.js"
      pattern: "Standalone component with internal rendering logic for size/priority."
    
    canvas:
      location: "src/ui/components/canvas/canvas-ui.js"
      pattern: "Controller that manages cards and layout modes (grid/freeform)."
    
    service:
      location: "src/features/card/card-service.js"
      pattern: "State slice pattern. Manages card data, horizon moves, and AI sorting."

risk_verdict:
  level: "Low"
  approval: "Proceed with implementation."

next_steps:
  - "Stage 4: Create detailed file implementation plan."
  - "Stage 5: Execute changes."
