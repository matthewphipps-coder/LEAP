  proposedChanges:
    - "INSERT 'Salvage Scan' into bump-protocol.yaml"
    - "INSERT 'Read Lessons' into goldsource-increment.yaml"
    - "INSERT 'Stage -0.5: Deconstruction Audit' into spec-discovery-protocol.yaml"
    - "CREATE 'prototype_template.html' in Templates/"
    - "CREATE 'LESSONS_LEARNED.md' in 3_resources/"

  questionsForUser:
    - "Do you have a preferred HTML boilerplate for the prototype template, or should I extract one from the Phase 31 Masonry prototype (the successful one)?"
