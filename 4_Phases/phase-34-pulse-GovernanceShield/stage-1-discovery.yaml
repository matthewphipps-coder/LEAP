    LEAP suffers from "Systemic Gaps" that allow visible failures (race conditions, wrong architectures) to persist.
    1. Systemic Amnesia: Lessons (e.g., Phase 31 Masonry) are deleted with the phase.
    2. Implicit Design: R&D prototypes are treated as visual suggestions, ignoring technical intent.
    3. Trust-Based Compliance: We assume AI follows architecture; it often doesn't.
  
  scope:
    included:
      - "1_LEAP/1_Governance/2_protocols/bump-protocol.yaml" (Add Salvage Protocol)
      - "1_LEAP/1_Governance/3_resources/LESSONS_LEARNED.md" (Create Registry)
      - "1_LEAP/2_Build_GoldSource/Methodology/goldsource-increment.yaml" (Mandate checks)
      - "1_LEAP/3_R&D_GoldSource/Discovery_Methodology/spec-discovery-protocol.yaml" (Audit newspec logic)
      - ".agent/workflows/newspec.md" (Add Deconstruction Audit)
    
    userSourcedScope:
      - "Audit newspec: Does it read GoldSource architecture?"
      - "Gap Identified: Missing `prototype_template.html` for rapid prototyping."
    excluded:
      - "2_GoldSource/scaffold/**" (NO CODE CHANGES in this phase)
  
  constraints:
    protocol: "Pulse Protocol (Strict)"
    folderNaming: "phase-xx-pulse-[description]"
    tracking: "No task.md allowed; use Stage Artifacts only"
  
  successCriteria:
    - "Master Lessons Registry exists and is readable"
    - "Salvage Protocol is documented and mandatory"
    - "Deconstruction Audit is part of the Spec workflow"

  questionsForUser:
    - "Do you have any specific 'Lessons Learned' from pre-Phase 31 that should be seeded into the registry?"
    - "Are there any other governance files you want us to audit while we are in this mode?"

nextStep: "Stage 2: Research (Deep dive into the target governance files)"
