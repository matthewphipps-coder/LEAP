  summary: |
    Phase 34 "Governance Shield" successfully implemented the 4 critical pillars of the 7-Point Remediation Plan.
    We have moved from "Trusting the AI" to "Enforcing the Rules" via protocol texts.
    
    Completed Scope:
    1. **LEAP-073 Master Lessons Registry**: Created `1_LEAP/1_Governance/3_resources/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`.
    2. **LEAP-070 Salvage Protocol**: Added strict "Scan First" rule to `bump-protocol.yaml`.
    3. **LEAP-071 Folder Discipline**: Hardened `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` with "Folder Jail" rules.
    4. **LEAP-068 Deconstruction**: Added "Stage -0.5" to `spec-discovery-protocol.yaml`.
    
    Bonus Wins:
    - **Prototype Template**: Created `prototype_template.html` with Phase 31 Masonry logic.
    - **Freshness Rule**: Added `goldsource-increment.yaml` rule to keep template updated.

  lessonsLearned:
    - "Pulse Protocol is superior for governance work (avoids task.md overhead)."
    - "User Insight Gates are powerful - user caught the missing 'prototype_template.html' gap during Discovery."
    - "Strict Protocol Adherence (stopping for !Proceed) builds trust."

  handoff:
    nextPhase: "Phase 35: The Safety Net (Automated Verification)"
    recommendation: "Proceed immediately to Phase 35 to implementation the `gov-check.sh` script."

  signOff: "Awaiting Human Sign-off to mark Phase 34 complete."
