  summary: |
    Phase 35 "Safety Net" is complete.
    We have moved from "Trusting" the AI to "Verifying" the AI.
    
    Deliverables:
    1. **gov-check.sh**: Automated bash script to detect architectural violations.
    2. **Methodology Update**: Stage 6 now strictly requires "Run Governance Check".
    3. **Baseline Validation**: Current code passes all checks (Clean Slate).
    
    Impact:
    - **No more** `updateSidebarForPage` (Imperative UI).
    - **No more** `setTimeout` in boot (Race Conditions).
    - **No more** direct DOM access in services (Architecture).
    
  lessonsLearned:
    - "Automated checks are faster and more reliable than manual checklists."
    - "Providing the script prevents the AI from 'hallucinating' a check."
    
  handoff:
    nextPhase: "Phase 36: Architectural Restoration"
    focus: "Refactoring the 'Reactive State' (LEAP-067) and 'Global Layout' (LEAP-069) to fix the root causes."
    
  signOff: "Awaiting Human Sign-off."
