  context: "Read during Discovery stage of feature phases"

vision:
  tagline: "It's 2026. Reinvent now."
  
  whatItIs:
    primary: "Living demo platform showing the future of ServiceNow in an AI-agent world"
    secondary: "Proof that AI can build enterprise demos faster than traditional methods"
    metaNarrative: "LEAP is both the message (AI-first future) AND the medium (AI-built demo)"
  
  whyItMatters:
    urgency: "Enterprise work must be reinvented for the AI age - it's 2026, not 2015"
    dualImpact:
      customers: "Shows what ServiceNow could become (AI agents, not forms)"
      internal: "Proves how demos should be built (AI, not Figma/Reprise)"
  
  howItsDifferent:
    - "AI agents as first-class citizens (not chatbots)"
    - "Natural language + cards (not forms and lists)"
    - "Built entirely by AI in weeks (not months of manual work)"
    - "Adapts to any customer scenario (flexible, not static)"
  
  howWeBuiltIt:
    methodology: "AI-first development with human oversight"
    governance: "13 partnership rules + 8-stage lifecycle + stage gates"
    
    keyInnovations:
      - "Rule 13: Technical onboarding (AI reads architecture before coding)"
      - "Stage gates: Validation catches errors before delivery"
      - "Stage artifacts: Complete audit trail of every decision"
      - "RRMD+ protocol: Risk assessment for significant changes"
    
    validation: "Phase 21.3: Governance caught AI mistake (broken app), enabled recovery, delivered quality code"
    
    significance: "This methodology is replicable - any team can adopt it"
  
  targetAudiences:
    - "ServiceNow demo creation teams (adopt AI-first demo methodology)"
    - "ServiceNow executives (approve AI-first strategy)"
    - "Customer C-suite (buy the vision of AI-first enterprise)"
    - "Customer IT leaders (understand the future of work)"

      - "When making UX decisions (what should LEAP feel like?)"
    
    whenNotNeeded:
