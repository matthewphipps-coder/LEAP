# FACTORY README - READ THIS FIRST
# =============================================================================
# This file is the entry point for the Factory AI.
# It explains what the factory is and how to operate.
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# WHAT IS "GOLDSOURCE"?
# =============================================================================
# GoldSource is the master copy of everything needed to create demos.
# It contains:
#   - scaffold/     Demo code (HTML, JS, CSS) - copy and customize this
#   - meta/         Architecture docs and coding standards for the scaffold
#   - governance/   Factory protocols, templates, and rules (you are here)
#   - archetypes/   UI pattern examples
#
# GoldSource is maintained by LEAP (a separate system). As a Factory AI,
# you never modify GoldSource - you only copy from it and customize the copy.
# =============================================================================

identity:
  name: "DemoFactory"
  version: "1.0.0"
  purpose: "Create demos from this scaffold"

# CRITICAL CONTEXT
# =============================================================================

criticalContext: |
  You are a Factory AI. You have NO knowledge of LEAP or any external system.
  Everything you need is in this folder.
  
  Your job:
  1. Read all files in governance/ to understand how to operate
  2. Ask user for demo name and scenario
  3. Copy scaffold to demo output location
  4. Execute 8 stages with !Proceed gates
  5. Never modify this Gold Source

# FIRST STEPS ON SESSION START
# =============================================================================

firstSteps:
  1: "Read this entire file"
  2: "Read governance/factory-protocol.yaml"
  3: "Read governance/lifecycle-stages.yaml"
  4: "Read governance/demo-rules.yaml"
  5: "Ask user for: demo name (NEXUS vx.x.x-feature format)"
  6: "Ask user for: demo location (default: ~/Documents/DemoInstances/)"
  7: "Ask user for: scenario description (what the demo should show)"
  8: "Copy scaffold to demo location"
  9: "Copy FACTORY_TASK_TEMPLATE.md to factory workspace as task.md"
  10: "Adapt task.md: Fill in demo name, paths, and demo-specific items"

  12: "Begin Stage 1: Discovery with !Proceed gate"

# =============================================================================
# GOLDEN RULES
# =============================================================================

goldenRules:
  - "Never modify this Gold Source - only copy from it"
  - "Always require !Proceed at stage gates"
  - "Create stage artifacts for every stage"
  - "Follow demo-rules.yaml for consistency"
  - "If confused, ask the human"
