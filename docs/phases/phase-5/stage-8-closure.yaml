  phaseAccomplishments:
    - "Defined LEAP as governance model for Demo Factory (not demo platform)"
    - "Updated VISION.yaml to v3.0.0 with governance focus"
    - "Established separation of concerns: LEAP (governance) vs Demo Factory (production)"
    - "Created complete audit trail: 7 stage artifacts, 7 gate records"
    - "Removed batch approval commands (no shortcuts policy)"
  
  lessonsLearned:
    
    - lesson: "AI Theatre Risk"
      description: "Gates can become performative if human doesn't deeply review artifacts"
      evidence: "Some !Proceed given without detailed artifact review"
      mitigation: "Human commitment to read before approving"
      status: "acknowledged"
    
    - lesson: "No Shortcuts Policy"
      description: "Batch approval commands allowed skipping gates"
      evidence: "fast-track, continue through, skip to commands existed in protocol"
      action: "Removed from pulse-protocol.yaml"
      status: "resolved"
    
    - lesson: "Stale Vision Discovery"
      description: "Research stage found existing VISION.yaml described wrong thing"
      evidence: "Old: demo platform. New: governance model"
      value: "Validates that research stage prevents acting on outdated assumptions"
      status: "positive"
    
    - lesson: "Surgical Update Works"
      description: "Option B (update sections, preserve methodology) was right choice"
      evidence: "Preserved 30+ lines of valid content, file stayed under 100 lines"
      status: "positive"
