  questionsAnswered:
    
    - question: "What is LEAP's core purpose?"
      status: "answered"
      answer: |
        LEAP is a governance model that orchestrates and controls a Demo Factory.
        - LEAP and the Demo Factory are separate (separation of concerns)
        - LEAP builds the Demo Factory
        - The Demo Factory builds ServiceNow demos
        - LEAP also checks output of Demo Factory (continuous improvement cycle)
    
    - question: "Who is the target user?"
      status: "answered"
      answer: |
        - LEAP: Matthew Phipps (Architect) - sole developer
        - Demo Factory: Humans who want to build demos
        Note: LEAP is single-user governance; Demo Factory is multi-user
    
    - question: "What problem does LEAP solve?"
      status: "answered"
      answer: |
        - Traditional demo building is slow (months) and doesn't use AI
        - Without external governance, Demo Factory would self-certify as compliant
        - Without LEAP orchestration, factory reverts to vibe coding → garbage
        - LEAP ensures demo quality meets ServiceNow reputation standards
        Two-tier governance:
        - LEAP = End-to-end governance (builds factory right, validates output)
        - Demo Factory = Per-demo governance (builds each demo right)
    
    - question: "What makes LEAP different from existing solutions?"
      status: "answered"
      answer: |
        - Other AI methods: Fast but light on compliance → produce garbage
        - Traditional methods: Compliant but too slow, don't utilize AI
        - LEAP: Proves AI speed + governance rigor can coexist
        Differentiator: Best of both worlds (fast AND compliant)
    
    - question: "What is the minimum viable product (MVP)?"
      status: "answered"
      answer: "A Demo Factory that produces one type of demo"
