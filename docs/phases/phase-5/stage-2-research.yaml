  findings:
    
    - area: "Existing governance structure"
      status: "complete"
      findings:
        - "VISION.yaml already exists (3KB, 81 lines) - needs updating to reflect new discovery"
        - "Current VISION.yaml describes 'living demo platform for ServiceNow' - not governance model"
        - "constitution.yaml: 15 rules, document hierarchy, conflict resolution"
        - "agent-persona.yaml: 6 personas for peer review"
        - "pulse-protocol.yaml: 8 lifecycle stages, stage gates"
        - "13 governance files total (max 15 allowed)"
      gap: "Existing VISION.yaml describes old vision (demo platform), not new vision (governance for Demo Factory)"
    
    - area: "Demo Factory requirements"
      status: "complete"
      findings:
        - "Demo Factory is SEPARATE from LEAP (separation of concerns)"
        - "Demo Factory will have discrete steps to build demos"
        - "LEAP builds the factory; factory builds the demos"
        - "LEAP continuously validates factory output (feedback loop)"
        - "Quality standard: demos must not impact ServiceNow reputation"
      insight: "Demo Factory doesn't exist yet - LEAP must define what it needs before building"
    
    - area: "Vision documentation format"
      status: "complete"
      findings:
        - "VISION.yaml format already established (81 lines, good structure)"
        - "Contains: whatItIs, whyItMatters, howItsDifferent, howWeBuiltIt, targetAudiences"
        - "Has lifecycle metadata and humanInterface section"
        - "References other docs (project-overview, ARCHITECTURE, functionality)"
      recommendation: "Update existing VISION.yaml rather than create new file"
    
    - area: "Efficacy of AI governance"
      status: "complete"
      findings:
        externalEvidence:
          - "AI governance frameworks proven to enhance human-AI collaboration quality"
          - "Ethical guidelines + transparency + risk mitigation → improved decision-making"
          - "Human-centric design improves adoption (Kenya/Sweden case studies)"
          - "Agile governance with continuous monitoring detects risks early"
          - "Case: Scottish Government + Mind Foundry - explainable AI system"
          - "Failure mode: governance-light approaches produce garbage (confirmed by external research)"
        
        leapEvidence:
          - "Phase 21.3: Governance caught AI mistake (broken app), enabled recovery"
          - "Stage gates validated: errors caught before delivery"
          - "RRMD+ protocol: systematic risk assessment works"
          - "15 rules: comprehensive coverage without sprawl"
        
        keyInsight: "LEAP's governance model is aligned with industry best practices"

  fromDiscovery:
    corePurpose: "LEAP = governance for Demo Factory"
    targetUser: "Matthew Phipps (Architect)"
    problem: "AI speed without governance → garbage; Traditional methods too slow"
    differentiator: "AI speed + governance rigor"
    mvp: "Demo Factory that produces one demo type"
