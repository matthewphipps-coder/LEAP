  status: "in-progress"

stageObjective: "Analyze research findings, assess risks, identify approach options"

analysis:
  
  situationAssessment:
    current: "VISION.yaml describes LEAP as demo platform"
    required: "VISION.yaml should describe LEAP as governance for Demo Factory"
    gap: "Complete rewrite of vision content needed"
  
  riskAssessment:
    
    - risk: "Breaking existing references to VISION.yaml content"
      probability: "Low"
      impact: "Low"
      rationale: "VISION.yaml is reference document, not binding rules"
      mitigation: "Keep same file structure, update content only"
    
    - risk: "Losing useful content from current VISION.yaml"
      probability: "Medium"
      impact: "Low"
      rationale: "Some current content may still apply (howWeBuiltIt methodology)"
      mitigation: "Preserve methodology section, update vision sections"
    
    - risk: "Scope creep during rewrite"
      probability: "Medium"
      impact: "Medium"
      rationale: "Vision is foundational - temptation to over-engineer"
      mitigation: "Keep to 80-100 lines max, focus on core vision only"
  
  approachOptions:
    
    - option: "A - Full rewrite"
      description: "Replace all vision content with new governance-focused vision"
      pros:
        - "Clean slate"
        - "No legacy confusion"
      cons:
        - "Loses methodology documentation"
        - "More work"
    
    - option: "B - Surgical update"
      description: "Update vision sections, preserve methodology sections"
      pros:
        - "Keeps validated methodology content"
        - "Less risk"
        - "Faster"
      cons:
        - "May have inconsistencies between old and new sections"
    
    - option: "C - Addendum approach"
      description: "Add new governance vision, mark old vision as 'demo platform' context"
      pros:
        - "Preserves history"
        - "No content loss"
      cons:
        - "Confusing dual vision"
        - "File grows unnecessarily"
  
  recommendation:
    selected: "B - Surgical update"
    rationale: |
      - howWeBuiltIt section is still valid (methodology hasn't changed)
      - usage section is still valid
      - Only whatItIs, whyItMatters, howItsDifferent, targetAudiences need updating
      - Keeps within 80-100 lines
      - Lower risk than full rewrite

    - section: "vision.whyItMatters"
      current: "Enterprise work must be reinvented for AI age"
      proposed: "AI speed without governance produces garbage"
