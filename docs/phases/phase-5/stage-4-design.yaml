          secondary: "Proof that AI can build enterprise demos faster than traditional methods"
          metaNarrative: "LEAP is both the message (AI-first future) AND the medium (AI-built demo)"
        proposed: |
          primary: "Governance model that orchestrates and controls a Demo Factory"
          secondary: "Proves AI speed and governance rigor can coexist"
          architecture:
            leap: "Governance layer - builds the factory, validates output"
            demoFactory: "Production layer - builds ServiceNow demos (separate system)"
            relationship: "LEAP builds factory; factory builds demos; LEAP validates demos"
        rationale: "Reflects discovery Q&A - separation of concerns"

        proposed: |
          problem:
            traditional: "Demo building takes months, doesn't use AI"
            aiWithoutGovernance: "Fast but produces garbage (light on compliance)"
            selfCertification: "Without external governance, systems self-certify as compliant"
          solution:
            leap: "External governance that validates factory output"
            feedbackLoop: "Continuous improvement - each demo improves the factory"
            qualityStandard: "Demos must not impact ServiceNow reputation"
        rationale: "Captures specific problems LEAP solves"
      
      - section: "vision.howItsDifferent"
        current: |
          - "AI agents as first-class citizens"
          - "Natural language + cards"
          - "Built entirely by AI in weeks"
          - "Adapts to any customer scenario"
        proposed: |
          separationOfConcerns:
            - "LEAP = End-to-end governance (builds factory right)"
            - "Demo Factory = Per-demo governance (builds each demo right)"
          speedWithQuality:
            - "AI speed (days/weeks, not months)"
            - "Governance rigor (not garbage)"
          continuousImprovement:
            - "LEAP validates every demo output"
            - "Learnings feed back to improve factory"
