# =============================================================================
# LESSONS LEARNED
# =============================================================================

lessonsLearned:

  whatWorkedWell:
    - "Backtracking when stages became compliance theatre"
    - "Proper research found real ripple effects (18 files reference constitution)"
    - "User discussions on scope (Q1: delivery only, Q2: constitution only)"
    - "Using acceptanceCriteria on Phase 17 items before adding to template"
  
  whatCouldImprove:
    - "Initial attempt at stages 2-3 was rushed - caught by user feedback"
    - "Remember: GOVERNANCE IS CODE - don't treat it as less important"
  
  keyInsight: |
    The best lesson is the one we just encoded: LEAP governance YAML IS code.
    Skipping research/analysis for governance is as bad as skipping for app code.
