# RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
# =============================================================================

researchObjective: "Understand target files, dependencies, and ripple effects before planning changes"

# GOV-006: GOVERNANCE IS CODE PRINCIPLE
# =============================================================================

GOV006_Research:
  
  targetFile: "LEAP_Governance/constitution.yaml"
  targetSection: "governanceManagement (lines 33-40)"
  
  currentContent:
    governanceManagement:
      rule: "Maximum 15 governance files"
      enforcement: "Merge new rules into existing files, don't create new ones"
  
  referencedBy:
    total: 18
    critical:
      - "INDEX.yaml - canonical rules reference"
      - "agent-persona.yaml - AI behavior rules"
      - "session-start.yaml, new-agent.yaml - onboarding"
      - "bump-protocol.yaml, rrmd-protocol.yaml - extracted rules"
  
  rippleEffect: "LOW - adding new field is additive, not modifying existing"
  
  proposedLocation: "Add to governanceManagement section"
  
  scopingQuestion: |
    The principle says "LEAP governance YAML IS code".
    This must EXPLICITLY exclude GoldSource.
    Where else might this need mentioning?
    - new-agent.yaml? (onboarding)
    - pulse-protocol.yaml? (methodology)
    
  finding: "Constitution is correct location. Adding to governanceManagement is safe."

# GOV-003: DELIVERY STAGE TRACKING SYNC
# =============================================================================

GOV003_Research:
  
  targetFile: "LEAP_Governance/pulse-protocol.yaml"
  targetSection: "stageTransitions.completionCriteria.delivery (line 109)"
  
  currentContent:
    delivery: ["Backup created if required", "Closure document created", "Git commit done"]
  
  referencedBy:
    - "backlog.yaml (line 68) - references this section"
  
  otherLocations:
    - file: "checklists/session-start.yaml"
      section: "orient (lines 13-24)"
      issue: "!Pulse should also verify counts, not just delivery stage"
  
  finding: |
    Adding to delivery completionCriteria alone may be insufficient.
    The !Pulse check (session-start.yaml) doesn't verify counts either.
    QUESTION: Should we also add count verification to session-start orient section?

# GOV-005: DISCOVERY VALIDATION RULE
# =============================================================================

GOV005_Research:
  
  targetFile: "LEAP_Governance/pulse-protocol.yaml"
  targetSection: "stageTransitions.completionCriteria.discovery (line 103)"
  
  currentContent:
    discovery: ["Problem identified", "Scope understood", "Questions for research defined"]
  
  finding: |
    Need to add source verification requirement.
    "Already done" claims must be checked against ORIGINAL complaint document.
    
  proposedAddition: "'Already done' claims verified against source document"

# GOV-004: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR BACKLOG
# =============================================================================

GOV004_Research:
  
  targetFile: "LEAP_Governance/tracking/backlog.yaml"
  targetSection: "howToAdd.template (lines 374-385)"
  
  currentTemplate:
    fields: ["id", "name", "category", "priority", "status", "description", 
             "rationale", "estimatedEffort", "dependencies", "addedDate", "source"]
  
  missingField: "acceptanceCriteria"
  
  alreadyUsed:
    - "GOV-003, GOV-004, GOV-005, GOV-006 in Phase 17 already have acceptanceCriteria"
    - "This proves it's useful - we used it before defining it!"
  
  finding: |
    Easy addition - just add field to template.
    No ripple effect - template is documentation only.
    Existing items without acceptanceCriteria remain valid.

  potentialExpansion:

# =============================================================================
# QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================

questionsForAnalysis:
  - question: "Should GOV-003 also update session-start.yaml orient section?"
    context: "Delivery completionCriteria may not catch drift if !Pulse doesn't verify"
  
  - question: "Should GOV-006 mention be added to new-agent.yaml onboarding?"
    context: "New AIs need to know governance changes are serious"
  
  - question: "What's the exact wording for GOV-006 principle?"
    draft: |
      leapPrinciple: "In LEAP, governance YAML IS the code"
      implication: "Changes to LEAP_Governance files require FULL lifecycle stages"
      noSkipping: "Never skip research/analysis - YAML changes have ripple effects"
      scope: "LEAP_Governance only - does NOT apply to GoldSource factory"
