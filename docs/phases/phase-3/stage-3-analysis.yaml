  nextCheckpoint: "Design stage - implementation plan for approval"
  humanRole: "Confirm risk assessment and approach before detailed design"
  context: "Analyzing risks and options for partnership governance changes"

riskAssessment:
  overallRisk: "LOW"
  rationale: "All changes are additive to existing governance. No breaking changes."
  
  risks:
    - risk: "New rule could be ignored by future AI"
      probability: "medium"
      impact: "low"
      mitigation: "Rule 14 is constitutional - same enforcement as Rules 1-13"
    
    - risk: "Pulse checks could become checkbox compliance"
      probability: "medium"
      impact: "low"
      mitigation: "Checks ask reflective questions, not just yes/no"

designPrinciples:
  humanSlowDown: "ENFORCEMENT, not invitation"
  rationale: "Humans need slowing down as much as AI. AI looks after Human as much as Human looks after AI."
  tone: "Preachy when needed - this is about correctness, both parties need discipline"

rrmdDecision:
  triggered: false
  reason: "3 governance files, all additive changes, LOW overall risk"
  action: "Proceed without full RRMD+ protocol"

approachOptions:
  option1:
    name: "Comprehensive Rule 14"
    description: "Single new rule covering all mutual improvement aspects"
    pros:
      - "Clear, single location for partnership philosophy"
      - "Easy for future AI to find"
    cons:
      - "May be lengthy"
    recommendation: "PREFERRED"
  
  option2:
    name: "Distributed updates"
    description: "Add mutual improvement notes to existing rules"
    pros:
      - "Spreads context to relevant rules"
    cons:
      - "Harder to see complete picture"
      - "Could be missed during !pulse checks"
    recommendation: "NOT PREFERRED"

selectedApproach:
  rule14:
    structure:
      - "Core statement: Both parties explicitly here to improve each other"
      - "Human→AI mechanisms (gates, feedback, reality checks)"
      - "AI→Human mechanisms (analysis, risk identification, documentation)"
      - "Both parties slow down commitment"
  
  pulseEnhancement:
    structure:
      - "Add mutual improvement checks to existing partnership section"
