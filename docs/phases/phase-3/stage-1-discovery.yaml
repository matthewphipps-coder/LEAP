problemStatement:
  coreGoal: "Human and AI are explicitly here to make each other better at every phase and stage"
  summary: "LEAP governance should make the mutual improvement partnership explicit, not implicit"
  details:
    - "Human improves AI: through gates, feedback, reality checks, pace control"
    - "AI improves Human: through analysis, risk identification, structured thinking, documentation"
    - "This mutual improvement should be visible and trackable, not assumed"

proposedChanges:

    adopt:
      - change: "Partnership model documentation"

      - change: "Partnership health check"
