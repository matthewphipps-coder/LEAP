  checkpointRequired: true
  nextCheckpoint: "Confirm problem statement and scope before research"
  humanRole: "Clarify ServiceNow audit requirements"
  context: "High stakes - financial and reputational impact"

problemStatement:
  coreGoal: "Prepare LEAP for ServiceNow external audit"
  context: "ServiceNow will audit LEAP for compliance, standards, and value"
  stakes: "Failure has significant financial and reputational impact on ServiceNow and LEAP"

confirmedAuditRequirements:
  requirement1:
    name: "Audited !Proceed at every stage gate"
    description: "The ONLY permissible authority to move to next stage is a fully audited !Proceed statement"
    implication: "Every stage transition must have explicit !Proceed (not 'yep' or informal approval)"
  
  requirement2:
    name: "Conversation demonstrating mutual understanding"
    description: "Before !Proceed, there must be documented 'conversation' showing both AI and Human fully understand what will be done next AND all governance is being complied with"
    implication: "Sounds like !pulse at each gate - forces governance check before authorization"
  
  requirement3:
    name: "Full recording at each gate"
    description: "Must be fully recorded at each phase, stage, and gate for future audit"
    implication: "Need audit trail artifacts beyond current stage artifacts"

  requirement4:
    name: "Real-time compliance documentation"
    description: "Compliance docs created/updated at each stage gate - not theatre/after-the-fact"
    implication: "Audit trail is genuine, created as work happens"
  
  requirement5:
    name: "Value metrics: Quality and Consistency"
    description: "Value of LEAP = quality of demo through compliant human/AI partnership"
    metrics:
      - "Quality improvements"
      - "Consistency/reproducibility"
    risk: "Demo failure in front of customer = significant financial/reputational impact"
  
  requirement6:
    name: "Immutability of audit records"
    description: "AI CANNOT retrospectively change a previously documented YAML"
    rationale: "True compliance, not theatre - audit records are immutable once created"
    enforcement: "Gate records once committed are READ-ONLY to AI"
