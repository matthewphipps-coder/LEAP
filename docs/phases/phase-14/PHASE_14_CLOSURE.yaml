# PHASE SUMMARY
# =============================================================================

summary:
  objective: "Restructure DemoFactory to be a process engine, move scaffold to GoldSource"
  outcome: "SUCCESS - Complete restructure with self-contained factory governance"
  
  deliverables:
    - name: "GoldSource Structure"
      status: "complete"
      location: "GoldSource/"
    - name: "Factory Governance"
      status: "complete"
      files: 14
    - name: "ARCHITECTURE.yaml v2.0.0"
      status: "complete"

# KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
# =============================================================================

keyDecisions:
  
  - decision: "Three-Layer Architecture"
    description: "LEAP → Factory (separate AI) → Demo Output"
    rationale: "Prevents bias, error accumulation, and control loss"
  
  - decision: "Complete AI Session Isolation"
    description: "Factory AI is separate conversation, history deleted"
    rationale: "Zero carryover, fresh context for each demo"
  
  - decision: "Gold Source First"
    description: "Copy Gold Source BEFORE Discovery stage"
    rationale: "Factory needs context to operate"
  
  - decision: "Factory Governance Self-Contained"
    description: "All protocols, templates in Gold Source"
    rationale: "Factory unaware of LEAP"
  
  - decision: "ARCHITECTURE.yaml Duplicated"
    description: "LEAP master, Gold Source copy"
    rationale: "Factory cannot reference LEAP"

# =============================================================================
# LESSONS LEARNED
# =============================================================================

lessonsLearned:
  
  whatWorkedWell:
    - "RRMD+ protocol ensured proper risk assessment before restructure"
    - "Backup commit provided safety net"
    - "git mv preserved history"
    - "Iterative discovery clarified vision"
  
  whatCouldImprove:
    - "Initial Phase 13 misconception could have been caught earlier"
    - "Factory governance templates could be tested with real run"
  
  feedbackForFuture:
    - "Test factory with actual demo creation in next phase"
    - "Consider adding preview.png to archetypes"

# =============================================================================
# CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
# =============================================================================

continuousImprovement:
  note: |
    LEAP's role is to continuously improve the factory based on each run.
    After each factory run, lessons learned should be incorporated into Gold Source.
    The factory keeps getting better.
  
  nextPhase:
    suggestion: "Run factory to create actual demo, gather lessons"
