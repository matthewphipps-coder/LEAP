# LESSONS LEARNED
# =============================================================================

lessonsLearned:

  whatWorkedWell:
    - "8-stage lifecycle kept work organized"
    - "Gate approvals at each transition prevented scope creep"
    - "Research stage validated assumptions (templates existed but weren't enforced)"
    - "Option-based approach in Analysis made decision clear"
  
  whatCouldImprove:
    - "Initial Discovery found templates 'already done' but missed quality issues"
    - "User skepticism was correct - need deeper inspection before claiming 'done'"
  
  feedbackForLEAP:
    - "MANDATORY sections should become standard pattern for all governance docs"
    - "gateApproval + previousStage creates complete audit trail"
