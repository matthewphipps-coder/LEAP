# LESSONS LEARNED
# =============================================================================

lessonsLearned:
  - id: "LL-001"
    category: "Process"
    lesson: "Long visual iteration sessions can drift away from governance"
    context: "Discovery took ~45 minutes of CSS tweaking without creating phase folder or artifacts"
    correction: "User reminded to check pulse, artifacts were created retroactively"
    recommendation: "Create phase folder FIRST before any code. Update discovery artifact AS iterating."
  
  - id: "LL-002"
    category: "Design"
    lesson: "3-color brand system more flexible than 2-color"
    context: "Started with primary+secondary, user requested accent color for plasma variety"
    recommendation: "Future specs should default to 3-color brand system"
  
  - id: "LL-003"
    category: "Design"
    lesson: "Bold brand colors should never fill large areas"
    context: "Instructions box was accidentally made solid purple at 85% opacity"
    correction: "Changed to neutral glass with purple border accent only"
    recommendation: "Document as design principle: brand colors for accents only"

# HANDOFF TO NEXT PHASE
# =============================================================================

nextPhaseHandoff:
  recommendedNext: "LEAP-035 (Authentication) or LEAP-037 (App Shell)"
  rationale: |
    With design system complete, next logical specs are:
    - SPEC-001: Authentication (medium effort, completes login flow)
    - SPEC-003: App Shell (medium effort, extensibility)
    - SPEC-004: Data Conventions (small effort, depends on auth)
