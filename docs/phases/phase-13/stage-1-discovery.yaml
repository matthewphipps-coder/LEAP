problemStatement:
  summary: "Build the first working prototype of DemoFactory"
  context:
    - "LEAP = Governance layer (builds and validates the factory)"
    - "DemoFactory = Production layer (builds ServiceNow demos)"
    - "Current state: LEAP governance is mature (12 phases complete), but no DemoFactory code exists"
  
  goal: "Create a functional prototype that demonstrates demo-building capability"

scope:
  inScope:
    - "Core DemoFactory architecture"
    - "Minimum viable demo-building capability"
    - "Integration with LEAP governance"
  
  outOfScope:
    - "Full feature set (future phases)"
    - "Multi-user support (LEAP is single-user per VISION.yaml)"
    - "Production deployment"
  
  tbd:
    - "What constitutes a 'demo' (output format, components)?"
    - "What is the minimum viable functionality?"
    - "Technology stack confirmation"

questionsForResearch:
  architectural:
    - "What technology stack should DemoFactory use (per architectural-standards.yaml)?"
    - "How does the Triad Pattern (Service/UI/Style) apply to DemoFactory?"
    - "What is the data flow (Firebase → State → UI)?"
  
  functional:
    - "What does 'building a demo' mean concretely?"
    - "What inputs does DemoFactory need from users?"
    - "What outputs should DemoFactory produce?"
  
  integration:
    - "How does LEAP validate DemoFactory output?"
    - "What is the feedback loop between demos and factory improvement?"
  
  existingResources:
    - "Are there any prior specifications or mockups for DemoFactory?"
    - "What ServiceNow components are relevant?"
