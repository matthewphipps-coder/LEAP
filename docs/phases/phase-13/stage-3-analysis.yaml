# RISK ASSESSMENT
# =============================================================================

riskAssessment:
  
  risks:
    
    - id: "RISK-001"
      name: "Scaffold Scope Creep"
      description: "Immutable foundation becomes too large, leaving nothing for AI to customize"
      likelihood: "medium"
      impact: "medium"
      mitigation: "Start minimal, add components only when needed"
    
    - id: "RISK-002"
      name: "AI Pattern Violation"
      description: "AI breaks locked patterns (e.g., bypasses StateManager, uses inline events)"
      likelihood: "high"
      impact: "high"
      mitigation: "Validation stage checks for pattern violations"
    
    - id: "RISK-003"
      name: "Prototype Overengineering"
      description: "Building too much infrastructure for a learning exercise"
      likelihood: "medium"
      impact: "low"
      mitigation: "Focus on minimum viable scaffold, plan for v2 rebuild"
    
    - id: "RISK-004"
      name: "Unclear Demo Scope"
      description: "No concrete example of what a 'future vision demo' should show"
      likelihood: "high"
      impact: "high"
      mitigation: "Define one specific demo scenario before implementation"

  overallRisk: "medium"
  recommendation: "Proceed with caution - define concrete demo scenario first"

# =============================================================================
# RRMD+ DECISION
# =============================================================================

rrmdDecision:
  question: "Is a full RRMD+ (Risk-Reward-Mitigation-Dependencies) document required?"
  
  decision: "No"
  
  rationale:
    - "This is a prototype explicitly designed to be thrown away (clean room rebuild)"
    - "Risks are manageable through standard stage gates"
    - "No production deployment, no external dependencies"
    - "Human-in-the-loop at every gate provides sufficient oversight"
  
  note: "If scope expands beyond prototype, reassess RRMD+ need"

# =============================================================================
# APPROACH OPTIONS
# =============================================================================

approachOptions:
  
  optionA:
    name: "Scaffold-First"
    description: "Build complete immutable foundation first, then create demo"
    pros:
      - "Foundation is solid before AI uses it"
      - "Patterns established upfront"
    cons:
      - "May overbuild scaffold without knowing what's needed"
      - "Longer time to first demo"
  
  optionB:
    name: "Demo-First"
    description: "Build a specific demo manually, extract scaffold patterns after"
    pros:
      - "Discover actual patterns through practice"
      - "Faster to first working demo"
      - "Scaffold based on real needs"
    cons:
      - "Demo may have inconsistent patterns"
      - "Refactoring needed to extract scaffold"
  
  optionC:
    name: "Incremental Scaffold"
    description: "Start with minimal scaffold, add components as demo needs them"
    pros:
      - "Balanced approach"
      - "Scaffold grows with actual needs"
      - "Each component justified by use"
    cons:
      - "May need refactoring as scaffold grows"
  
  recommendation: "Option C - Incremental Scaffold"
  rationale: "Prototype is for learning - build only what we need, learn what matters"

# =============================================================================
# CONCRETE DEMO SCENARIO (Required before implementation)
# =============================================================================

concreteScenario:
  status: "TBD"
  requirement: "Must define ONE specific demo scenario before Design stage"
  
  questions:
    - "What is the demo about? (e.g., IT agent, HR assistant, approval workflow)"
    - "What 2-3 screens/views does it need?"
    - "What interaction patterns should it showcase?"
    - "What 'future vision' element makes it compelling?"
