  orchestrationOptions:
    
    optionA:
      name: "Multi-Agent Orchestration"
      description: "LEAP orchestrates multiple AI executions, each handling one stage with fresh context"
      pros:
        - "Fresh context per stage - no accumulated confusion"
        - "Each AI gets focused, scoped task"
        - "Stage artifacts are natural handoff contracts"
        - "Parallel execution possible for independent stages"
      cons:
        - "Orchestration complexity"
        - "Handoff overhead between agents"
        - "Potential context loss between stages"
      implementation:
        - "LEAP provides stage-specific prompt + previous stage artifact"
        - "AI executes one stage, produces artifact"
        - "LEAP validates artifact against gate criteria"
        - "LEAP initiates next agent with new context"
    
    optionB:
      name: "Single-Agent with Stage Gates"
      description: "One AI session, but explicit gates force pause/validation between stages"
      pros:
        - "Accumulated context (AI remembers previous work)"
        - "Simpler orchestration"
        - "Natural conversation flow"
      cons:
        - "Context window limits (accumulated tokens)"
        - "Context pollution (earlier confusion affects later stages)"
        - "Harder to restart mid-process"
      implementation:
        - "Single long-running AI session"
        - "LEAP inserts gate checks between stages"
        - "AI must produce artifact and await approval before continuing"
    
    optionC:
      name: "Human-in-the-Loop Hybrid"
      description: "AI proposes, human approves at each gate (like LEAP today)"
      pros:
        - "Maximum control and oversight"
        - "Proven model (LEAP uses it successfully)"
        - "Human catches AI errors at each stage"
      cons:
        - "Slowest option (human bottleneck)"
        - "Defeats 'AI speed' goal for high-volume demos"
        - "Human fatigue on repetitive demos"
      implementation:
        - "AI executes stage, produces artifact"
        - "Human reviews artifact, provides !Proceed"
        - "Repeat for each stage"
