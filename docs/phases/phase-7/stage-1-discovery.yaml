problem:
  statement: "AI violates governance rules even when documented"
  rootCause: "Monolithic docs (755+ lines) are skimmed, not followed"
  evidence: "AI violated Proceed protocol earlier this session despite reading it"

goal:
  description: "Redesign governance into indexed smaller files easier for AI to follow"

discoveries:

  fileSizeGuidelines:
    checklists: "15-30 lines (action-oriented, hard to skip)"
    rules: "30-50 lines each (self-contained context)"
    reference: "100-300 lines (deep reading when needed)"
  
  proposedStructure:
    index: "INDEX.yaml guides AI to right file at right time"
    checklists:
      - "session-start.yaml"
      - "before-file-op.yaml"
      - "before-phase.yaml"
    rules: "Each of 15 rules gets own file"
    reference: "Full docs for deep reading"
  
  migrationPath:
    - "Create new structure in Governance/v2/"
    - "Test with one phase of work"
    - "If successful, replace old files"
    - "Archive old files temporarily"

questionsForResearch:
  - "Which existing rules can merge?"
  - "What's the minimum viable INDEX.yaml?"
  - "How do checklists reference full rules?"
