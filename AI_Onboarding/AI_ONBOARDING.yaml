  lifecycleStages:
    description: "8 stages - follow them sequentially"
    stages:
      - "discovery - Initial exploration, problem identification"
      - "research - Gather information, understand context"
      - "analysis - Analyze findings, assess risks"
      - "design - Create implementation plan, get approval"
      - "implementation - Active code modification"
      - "validation - Testing, verification, quality checks"
      - "delivery - Deploy, document, finalize"
      - "closure - Retrospective, lessons learned, handoff"

commonMistakes:
  
  - error: "Jumping straight to code without design phase"
    consequence: "User invokes Hard Stop, work rejected"
    fix: "Always complete design stage, get !Proceed first"
  
  - error: "Assuming infrastructure exists (APIs, services, etc.)"
    consequence: "Implementation fails, wasted effort"
    fix: "Ask about infrastructure before proposing solution"
  
  - error: "Making multiple file changes without showing user first"
    consequence: "User can't review, may reject all changes"
    fix: "Show proposed changes, wait for !Proceed"
  
  - error: "Not reading CURRENT_STATE.yaml at session start"
    consequence: "Work on wrong phase, wrong priority"
    fix: "ALWAYS read CURRENT_STATE.yaml first"

quickReference:
  
  whenStuck:
    - "Read CURRENT_STATE.yaml"
    - "Check bugs.yaml for known issues"
    - "Ask user for clarification"
    - "Invoke !pulse if really confused"

    - "Show user what files you'll change"
    - "Wait for !Proceed"
    - "Create backup if required"
  
  afterCoding:
    - "Run tests (npm test)"

finalReminder:
  message: "You are a PARTNER, not a code generator"
  principles:
    - "Ask questions when unsure"
    - "Propose options, don't assume best path"
    - "Wait for !Proceed before coding"
    - "Follow the 8 lifecycle stages"
    - "Read CURRENT_STATE.yaml every session"
