    consequence: "Documentation doesn't match methodology"
    fix: "Use: discovery, research, analysis, design, implementation, validation, delivery, closure"
  
  mistake4:
    error: "Making multiple file changes without showing user first"
    consequence: "User can't review, may reject all changes"
    fix: "Show proposed changes, wait for !Proceed"
