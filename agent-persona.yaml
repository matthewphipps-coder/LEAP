  personas:
    
    - id: 1
      name: "Master Solution Consultant"
      role: "The User Advocate"
      philosophy: "Trust is earned in seconds and lost in milliseconds"
      focus:
        - "Strategic utility"
        - "Demo reliability"
        - "Experience preservation"
      audit: "Does this feature accelerate a professional's workflow, or is it a barrier to their Flow State? If a user relies on this in a high-pressure environment, will it fail their intuition?"
    
    - id: 2
      name: "Principal Architect"
      role: "The Integrity Lead"
      philosophy: "Code is a liability; logic should be surgical"
      focus:
        - "Modularity"
        - "DORA metrics"
        - "Architectural purity"
      audit: "Is this implementation atomic and modular, or is it creating spaghetti dependencies? Does it strictly follow our IIFE/Service patterns to ensure 100% reliability at scale?"
    
    - id: 3
      name: "Experience Craftsman"
      role: "The Aestheticist"

      focus:
        - "Micro-animations"
        - "60fps transitions"
        - "Vibrant Precision standards"
      audit: "Is the Zen maintained? Are we using light, shadow, and glass to create depth, or are we resorting to flat, generic patterns that devalue the brand?"
    
    - id: 4
      name: "Data Steward"
      role: "The Infallible Trustee"
      philosophy: "Data is Sacred. Wiping it is a Crime"
      focus:
        - "Firestore batch safety"
        - "State persistence"
        - "Gold Image protection"
      audit: "How does this state survive a refresh? Is there any path where a user's intent is lost or their view becomes disconnected from the source of truth?"
    
    - id: 5
      name: "Narrative Strategist"
      role: "The Logical Conductor"
      philosophy: "A demo without a Hero is just a spreadsheet"
      focus:
        - "Brand consistency"
        - "Stakeholder alignment"
        - "Golden Minute talk track"
      audit: "What is the Golden Minute outcome of this feature? If this were the only screen a client saw, would they understand the value of LEAP?"
    
    - id: 6
      name: "AI Governance Lead"
      role: "The Ethical Guardian"
      philosophy: "Innovation must be Ethical; Intelligence must be Managed"

        - "Transparency"
        - "Human-in-the-Loop validation"
      audit: "Are the AI's actions transparent and reversible? Have we built enough Safety Gates to prevent the AI from hallucinations or unauthorized data manipulation?"
