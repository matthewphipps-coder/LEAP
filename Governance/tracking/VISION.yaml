vision:
  tagline: "AI Speed + Governance Rigor"
  
  whatItIs:
    primary: "Governance model that orchestrates and controls a Demo Factory"
    secondary: "Proves AI speed and governance rigor can coexist"
    architecture:
      leap: "Governance layer - builds the factory, validates output"
      demoFactory: "Production layer - builds ServiceNow demos (separate system)"
      relationship: "LEAP builds factory; factory builds demos; LEAP validates demos"
  
  whyItMatters:
    problem:
      traditional: "Demo building takes months, doesn't use AI"
      aiWithoutGovernance: "Fast but produces garbage (light on compliance)"
      selfCertification: "Without external governance, systems self-certify as compliant"
    solution:
      leap: "External governance that validates factory output"
      feedbackLoop: "Continuous improvement - each demo improves the factory"
      qualityStandard: "Demos must not impact ServiceNow reputation"
  
  howItsDifferent:
    separationOfConcerns:
      - "LEAP = End-to-end governance (builds factory right)"
      - "Demo Factory = Per-demo governance (builds each demo right)"
    speedWithQuality:
      - "AI speed (days/weeks, not months)"
      - "Governance rigor (not garbage)"
    continuousImprovement:
      - "LEAP validates every demo output"
      - "Learnings feed back to improve factory"
  
  targetAudiences:
    leapUsers:
      - user: "Matthew Phipps (Architect)"
        role: "Sole developer of LEAP governance"
    demoFactoryUsers:
      - user: "Demo requesters"
        role: "Humans who want to build demos"
    note: "LEAP is single-user governance; Demo Factory is multi-user"
  
  howWeBuiltIt:
    methodology: "AI-first development with human oversight"
    governance: "15 partnership rules + 8-stage lifecycle + stage gates"
    
    keyInnovations:
      - "Rule 13: Technical onboarding (AI reads architecture before coding)"
      - "Rule 14: Mutual improvement partnership (both parties make each other better)"
      - "Rule 15: Gate record immutability (audit compliance)"
      - "Stage gates: Validation catches errors before delivery"
      - "Stage artifacts: Complete audit trail of every decision"
      - "RRMD+ protocol: Risk assessment for significant changes"
    
    validation: "Phase 21.3: Governance caught AI mistake (broken app), enabled recovery, delivered quality code"
    
    significance: "This methodology is replicable - any team can adopt it"

usage:
  forAI:
    whenToRead:
      - "At start of Discovery stage for feature phases"
      - "When designing new features (does it align with vision?)"
      - "When making UX decisions (what should LEAP feel like?)"
    
    whenNotNeeded:
      - "Every session start (use CURRENT_STATE.yaml instead)"
      - "Bug fixes (vision doesn't change)"
      - "Governance updates (vision doesn't change)"
  
  forHumans:
    - "Share with stakeholders to explain LEAP purpose"
    - "Reference when pitching to customers or internal teams"
    - "Use as north star for feature prioritization"
